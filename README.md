## Dependent Software and Packages

The Book-a-Doc CI/CD pipeline depends on several key technologies and services, each chosen to fulfil specific requirements of a modern automated deployment system.

### Core CI/CD Dependencies:

- **GitHub Actions:** Serves as my primary CI/CD platform, providing workflow automation directly integrated with my GitHub repository. GitHub Actions was selected for its seamless integration, extensive marketplace of pre-built actions, and cost-effective pricing structure.

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS):** Provides my cloud infrastructure through multiple managed services including ECS for container orchestration, ECR for image storage, and Systems Manager for configuration management.

- **Docker:** Handles containerisation of my applications, ensuring consistent deployment environments across development, testing, and production stages.

- **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service):** Manages our containerised applications with automatic scaling, load balancing, and health monitoring capabilities.

- **Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry):** Stores and manages my Docker container images securely with built-in vulnerability scanning.

- **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store:** Securely stores configuration data and sensitive information like database credentials and API keys.

### Development and Testing Dependencies:

- **Jest (v29.7.0):** Provides comprehensive testing capabilities for our backend API endpoints and business logic.

- **Vitest (v3.0.7):** Enables fast, concurrent testing of our React frontend components with excellent Vite integration.

- **Cypress (v13.17.0):** Facilitates end-to-end testing of complete user workflows across our application.

- **ESLint (v8.57.1) with Airbnb Configuration:** Enforces consistent code quality and style standards throughout my codebase.

- **MongoDB Memory Server (v10.1.4):** Creates isolated, in-memory database instances for reliable testing without affecting production data.

## Hardware Requirements

My CI/CD pipeline has been designed to run efficiently on standard cloud infrastructure while maintaining cost-effectiveness.

### Development Environment:

- Any modern computer with at least 8GB RAM for local development and testing
- 2GHz dual-core processor or better for acceptable build times
- 10GB free disk space for Docker images and build artifacts
- Reliable internet connection for accessing cloud services and downloading dependencies

### Production Environment:

My production infrastructure runs on AWS with the following specifications:
- **ECS Fargate Tasks:** 0.25 vCPU and 512MB RAM per container (scalable based on demand)
- **Container Registry:** Amazon ECR with lifecycle policies for automatic cleanup
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas with appropriate sizing based on data requirements
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch for logging and performance metrics

### Scalability Considerations:

The pipeline architecture supports horizontal scaling through AWS ECS auto-scaling capabilities. As demand increases, additional container instances are automatically provisioned. The CI/CD pipeline itself scales efficiently through GitHub Actions' parallel job execution and matrix build strategies.

## Comparison to Alternative Technology Choices

I carefully evaluated several alternatives before finalising my CI/CD stack. Here's how my chosen technologies compare to other options.

### GitHub Actions vs Alternatives:

- **GitHub Actions vs Jenkins:** I chose GitHub Actions over Jenkins for its seamless integration with my existing GitHub workflow and elimination of server maintenance overhead. While Jenkins offers more customisation options, GitHub Actions provides sufficient flexibility with significantly less complexity.

- **GitHub Actions vs GitLab CI:** GitHub Actions was selected over GitLab CI primarily for consistency with my development workflow and repository hosting. GitLab CI offers similar capabilities, but GitHub Actions' marketplace ecosystem and documentation quality gave it the advantage.

- **GitHub Actions vs CircleCI:** Though CircleCI provides excellent performance optimisations, GitHub Actions was chosen for its cost-effectiveness and integrated security features. The ability to manage repositories, CI/CD, and security scanning in one platform simplified my development workflow.

- **GitHub Actions vs Azure DevOps:** While Azure DevOps offers comprehensive project management features, GitHub Actions provided better integration with our existing tools and a more straightforward configuration process for our specific requirements.

### AWS vs Alternative Cloud Providers:

- **AWS vs Google Cloud Platform:** AWS was selected over GCP primarily for its stronger presence in the Australian market and more mature container orchestration services. While GCP offers competitive pricing and excellent Kubernetes support, AWS ECS provided the right balance of simplicity and functionality for my needs.

- **AWS vs Microsoft Azure:** Though Azure provides excellent integration with Microsoft development tools, AWS was chosen for its comprehensive service portfolio and better Australian data sovereignty options. The Sydney region availability was crucial for my compliance requirements.

- **AWS vs Heroku:** While Heroku offers simpler deployment processes, AWS provides greater scalability, customisation options, and long-term cost effectiveness. Heroku's limitations on container management and scaling made AWS the better choice for my growing application.

### Docker vs Alternative Containerisation:

- **Docker vs Podman:** Docker was chosen over Podman for its wider industry adoption, extensive documentation, and seamless integration with our chosen cloud services. While Podman offers security advantages, Docker's ecosystem maturity made it the practical choice.

- **Docker vs Traditional VMs:** Containerisation with Docker provides significantly better resource efficiency and faster deployment times compared to traditional virtual machines. The consistent environment guarantees eliminated deployment inconsistencies we experienced with VM-based approaches.

## Purpose of Chosen Technologies

Each technology in my CI/CD pipeline was carefully selected to address specific operational requirements.

- **GitHub Actions:** Automates my entire CI/CD pipeline, from code validation through production deployment, while maintaining close integration with my development workflow.

- **AWS ECS:** Provides serverless container orchestration, eliminating the need for infrastructure management while ensuring automatic scaling and high availability.

- **Amazon ECR:** Securely stores my container images with automated vulnerability scanning and lifecycle management for cost optimisation.

- **Docker:** Ensures consistent application environments across all deployment stages, eliminating configuration drift and "works on my machine" issues.

- **AWS Systems Manager:** Manages sensitive configuration data securely, providing encrypted storage and fine-grained access control for application secrets.

- **Jest/Vitest/Cypress:** Provides comprehensive testing coverage across unit, integration, and end-to-end scenarios, ensuring application reliability before deployment.

- **ESLint with Airbnb Configuration:** Maintains code quality standards and consistency across my development workflow, reducing bugs and improving maintainability.

## Licensing of Chosen Technologies

All technologies used in my CI/CD implementation were selected with careful consideration of their licensing terms to ensure compliance and minimise legal risks.

- **GitHub Actions:** Usage is governed by GitHub's Terms of Service, with generous free tier limits for public repositories and competitive pricing for private repositories.

- **Amazon Web Services:** Commercial cloud services with pay-per-use pricing model, ensuring we only pay for resources actually consumed.

- **Docker:** Docker Engine is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, allowing free use for most commercial applications. Docker Desktop requires licensing for large commercial organisations.

- **Jest:** Licensed under the MIT License, providing maximum flexibility for our testing requirements.

- **Vitest:** Licensed under the MIT License, ensuring compatibility with our open-source development approach.

- **Cypress:** Open-source version is licensed under the MIT License, with commercial support options available if needed.

- **ESLint:** Licensed under the MIT License, allowing unrestricted use in our development workflow.

The MIT License is advantageous for my project as it allows for unrestricted use, modification, and distribution, requiring only that the license notice be included in any substantial portions of the software. This gives me the freedom to develop and potentially commercialise my application without significant licensing constraints.

## CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

My CI/CD pipeline implements a comprehensive workflow that automates testing, building, and deployment processes while maintaining high security and reliability standards.

### Workflow Structure

#### Build and Test Workflow (`build.yml`)
This workflow executes on every push to main/develop branches and pull requests, implementing a multi-stage validation process:

1. **Dependency Installation:** Installs Node.js dependencies for both frontend and backend with intelligent caching to reduce build times
2. **Code Quality Checks:** Runs ESLint validation with Airbnb style guide enforcement
3. **Comprehensive Testing:** Executes unit tests, integration tests, and security validation
4. **Container Building:** Creates optimised Docker images for both frontend and backend
5. **Image Publishing:** Pushes validated images to Amazon ECR with appropriate tagging

#### Deployment Workflow (`deploy.yml`)
This workflow handles infrastructure provisioning and application deployment:

1. **Infrastructure Setup:** Automated creation and configuration of AWS ECS clusters, VPC settings, and security groups
