The fully containerised Book-A-Doc architecture is split into three main services:

- **Frontend (React + Vite)**
  - Port: `5173`
  - Provides the user interface for patients and doctors
  - Communicates with the backend API via HTTP requests
  - Resides on the `frontend-network`

- **Backend (Node.js + Express)**
  - Port: `3000`
  - Manages authentication, business logic, and API endpoints
  - Uses environment variables for secrets and configuration
  - Middleware includes Helmet (security), CORS, and a global error handler
  - Connected to both `frontend-network` and `backend-network`

- **MongoDB Database**
  - Port: `27017`
  - Stores application data (users, doctors, bookings)
  - Uses volume `mongo-data` for persistent storage  
  - Connected to `backend-network`

- **Docker Compose**
  - Coordinates the startup and dependency order of services via `depends_on`
  - Configures isolated bridge networks and volume bindings for data and communication integrity

## CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

### Workflow Overview

The CI/CD pipeline consists of four main GitHub Actions workflows that provide comprehensive automation:

#### 1. Testing Workflow (`test.yml`)
**Triggers:** Push to main/develop branches, Pull requests to main, Manual dispatch
**Purpose:** Comprehensive testing across all application layers

```yaml
# Parallel testing jobs for optimal performance
frontend-tests:
  - Vitest unit tests and component testing
  - ESLint code quality validation
  - Coverage reporting with artifact storage

backend-tests:
  - Jest unit tests with MongoDB Memory Server
  - Integration testing with Supertest
  - Security testing and vulnerability assessment

e2e-tests:
  - Cypress end-to-end testing with full application stack
  - Real browser testing with video recording
  - Complete user workflow validation

test-summary:
  - Consolidated test reporting across all test suites
  - Status aggregation and deployment readiness assessment
```

#### 2. Build and Test Workflow (`build.yml`)
**Triggers:** Push to main/develop branches, Pull requests to main
**Purpose:** Advanced build pipeline with container management

```yaml
# Multi-stage pipeline with advanced optimisations
install:
  - Dependency caching for performance optimisation
  - Parallel frontend/backend dependency installation
  
test:
  - Comprehensive testing with timeout management
  - Coverage reporting with artifact storage
  
security:
  - npm audit security scanning
  - Vulnerability assessment for production dependencies
  
build:
  - Conditional execution (main branch only)
  - AWS ECR integration and authentication
  - Docker image building with production optimisations
```

#### 3. Deployment Workflow (`deploy.yml`)
**Triggers:** Successful completion of build workflow, Manual dispatch
**Purpose:** Automated infrastructure provisioning and application deployment

```yaml
# Infrastructure as Code deployment
- AWS ECS Cluster Creation
- Security Groups & IAM Roles
- Container Image Publishing
- Blue-Green Deployment Strategy
- Health Monitoring & Validation
```

#### 4. Resource Cleanup Workflow (`cleanup.yml`)
**Triggers:** Manual dispatch only
**Purpose:** Complete AWS resource cleanup for cost management

```yaml
# Comprehensive resource cleanup
- ECS Services & Clusters
- ECR Repositories & Images
- CloudWatch Log Groups
- SSM Parameters & Secrets
- Security Groups & IAM Roles
```

### Testing Automation

Our testing strategy implements multiple validation layers to ensure application reliability:

- **Unit Testing:** Individual component and function testing using Jest (backend) and Vitest (frontend)
- **Integration Testing:** API endpoint testing with realistic data scenarios using Supertest and MongoDB Memory Server
- **Security Testing:** Comprehensive security validation including XSS prevention, injection attacks, and authentication testing
- **End-to-End Testing:** Complete user workflow validation using Cypress
- **Coverage Reporting:** Automated test coverage collection with artifact storage for CI/CD pipeline analysis

### Deployment Automation

The deployment process implements a sophisticated blue-green deployment strategy ensuring zero downtime:

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning:** Automated creation of AWS ECS clusters, security groups, and IAM roles
2. **Container Management:** Building and pushing optimised Docker images to Amazon ECR with vulnerability scanning
3. **Secrets Management:** Secure handling of sensitive configuration through AWS Parameter Store
4. **Service Deployment:** Blue-green deployment with automated health checks and rollback capabilities
5. **Monitoring Integration:** CloudWatch logging and performance metrics for ongoing observability

### Resource Management

The cleanup workflow demonstrates production-grade cost management:

- **Complete Resource Inventory:** Systematic cleanup of all AWS resources to prevent unexpected charges
- **Safe Deletion:** Proper dependency handling to avoid resource conflicts
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of missing or already-deleted resources
- **Audit Trail:** Comprehensive logging of all cleanup operations

---

## Containerisation Setup

### Docker Image Naming and Versioning

Each container image follows a consistent naming and tagging convention that reflects the application, environment, and version:  

#### Development Environment
- **Frontend**: `book-a-doc-frontend-v1.0-dev`
- **Backend**: `book-a-doc-backend-v1.0-dev`
- **MongoDB**: `book-a-doc-mongo-v1.0-dev`

#### Production Environment
- **Frontend**: `book-a-doc-frontend-v1.0-prod`
- **Backend**: `book-a-doc-backend-v1.0-prod`
- **MongoDB**: `book-a-doc-mongo-v1.0-prod`

These names improve traceability across environments and support the automated CI/CD pipeline image management.

### Environment Configuration

- Backend `.env` file stores:
  - `PORT`
  - `MONGODB_URI`
  - `JWT_SECRET`
  - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- These variables are injected at build/runtime using Docker Compose and excluded from the container via `.dockerignore`.

#### Development vs Production
- Development uses `.env` files for local configuration
- Production uses AWS Parameter Store for secure secrets management
- CI/CD pipeline automatically injects environment-specific configurations
- Sensitive information like `JWT_SECRET` and database credentials are handled securely through GitHub Secrets

â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.prod.yaml  # Production orchestration
â””â”€â”€ images/                   # Architecture diagrams
```

This structure ensures modular container builds, comprehensive testing coverage, and aligns with Docker best practices for isolated contexts.

### Build Optimisation

To maintain small, efficient container sizes and improve performance:  

- `.dockerignore` is used to exclude unnecessary files like `node_modules`, `dist`, `.env`, and logs.
- Multi-stage builds reduce final image size while maintaining build efficiency
- Production images include security hardening with non-root users and health checks
- The command `docker builder prune` can be used to clean up build cache:  

```bash
docker builder prune
```

## Running the Application

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [GitHub Account](https://github.com) (for CI/CD pipeline)
- [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com) (for production deployment)

### Clone Repositories
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TilleyCodes/Book-A-Doc-Back-End-web-Application
git clone https://github.com/TilleyCodes/Book-A-Doc-Front-End-Web-Application
```

### Environment Setup

Before running the frontend locally, create a .env file inside the frontend/ directory based on the provided .env.example. This environment file defines the backend API URL used during development.  

- To create your .env file:
```bash
cp frontend/.env frontend/.env
```

- The .env.example includes:
```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://book-a-doc-backend-v1.0-dev:3000
```

You can update VITE_API_URL if needed to point to a different backend server during development.

### Development Environment

- Run the application in development mode with:  
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

- Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
# Frontend tests
cd frontend && npm test

# Backend tests  
cd backend && npm test && npm run test:integration

# End-to-end tests
cd frontend && npm run test:e2e
```

- Frontend available at: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)  
- Backend available at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  

- Stop the development services:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Production Environment

Production deployment is handled automatically through the CI/CD pipeline, but can also be run manually:

- For local production testing, use the production configuration:  
```bash
# Create production environment file
cp backend/.env backend/.env.production
# Edit .env.production with production values

# Start production services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml up -d
```

- Production configuration includes:
  - Optimised build process with multi-stage builds
  - PM2 process manager for the backend
  - Nginx web server for the frontend
  - Security enhancements (HTTP headers, SSL support)
  - Automatic container restarts
  - Health checks and monitoring integration

- Monitor production logs:  
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml logs -f
```

- Stop production services:  
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml down
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Usage

1. **Automated Testing:** Push code to main/develop branches to trigger comprehensive testing
2. **Automated Deployment:** Successful tests automatically trigger deployment to AWS ECS
3. **Manual Cleanup:** Use GitHub Actions to manually trigger resource cleanup when needed
